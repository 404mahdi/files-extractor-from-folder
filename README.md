If you can bring them into one folder then you can install them at once. How do you do it? Just put an * in the search box? NO! Do it this way. Copy the source code and run the code (or use the .exe file) in your machine and follow the steps below.

<br>

### Steps:

1. Copy the folders to a directory if they are not already.
2. Copy the address of the directory.
